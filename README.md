This repository contains a set of scripts to perform airdrop functions for the Voi blockchain network.

There are four core scripts located in the `scripts` folder:
# Initial airdrop script - airdrop.js
Performs an airdrop of network tokens to the accounts in `<acctlist>`,
which is a CSV file containing three columns -- account address, account type, and atomic amount

Optional Parameters:
`<blacklist>` -- a CSV containing a list of accounts to exclude from the airdrop
`<group_size>` -- the number of accounts to include in each atomic transaction group
(note -- if an issue arrises with an address, such as it being invalid, all transactions
in the group will fail and be included in the errorList.csv generated by the script)
`<mnemonic>` -- this can be either a mnemonic string (space-separated words) entered inside quotes
on the command line, or the name of a text file containing the mnemonic string

Usage: `node airdrop.js -a <acctlist> [-b <blacklist>] [-g <group_size>] [-m "mnemonic"]`

# Epoch reward calculaton script - epoch_calc.js

Given a `STARTBLOCK` and `ENDBLOCK`, and an integer of atomic tokens
(`EPOCHREWARD`) to distribute evenly among block proposers, this script calculates the number of tokens
to distribute to each block proposer and writes it to `FILENAME`. This output file can then be used
as the `<acctList>` input to `airdrop.js` to airdrop the alloted tokens to each address.

Usage: `node epoch_calc.js -s STARTBLOCK -e ENDBLOCK -r EPOCHREWARD -f FILENAME`

# Account bucketing scirpt - buckets.js

Usage: `node buckets.js`

NOTE: buckets.js is incomplete. 

# Block finder by timestamp - find_block.js

Given a GMT timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:II:SS, find the block produced at the specified time,
or the next block produced after the specified time. For example, if block 123 is produced at 2023-08-30T07:59:59
and block 124 is produced at 2023-08-30T08:00:01, and the `TIMESTAMP` input is 2023-08-30T08:00:00 then the script
will return 124.

Usage: `node find_block.js -t TIMESTAMP`
